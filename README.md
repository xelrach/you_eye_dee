# You Eye Dee

You Eye Dee is a collection of Rust libraries that manage unique identifiers like UUID and ULID. This includes SIMD accelerated parsing of a unique ID into an integer and SIMD accelerated encoding of an integer into the text form.

This code is highly experimental and should not be used at this time.
